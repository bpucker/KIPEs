# KIPEs is not restricted to analyzing the flavonoid biosynthesis. This README explains how to add a new pathway to KIPEs.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please get in touch, we are already working on the integration of additional pathways. You might be able to save time and energy.

## 1) find paper describing the pathway/reactions
KIPEs is based on information already available in the literature. Therefore, it is crucial to identify well characterized bait sequences and conserved amino acid residues in the active center.

## 2) find initial characterized sequence(s)
## 3) run tree building script
## 4) collect resulting FASTA file
## 5) construct tree via tree.py
## 6) rename seqs in tree
## 7) inspect tree manually in figtree; identify clade based on amborella/monocots; color clade in red
## 8) extract red sequences
## 9) repeat tree building and cleaning until final result
